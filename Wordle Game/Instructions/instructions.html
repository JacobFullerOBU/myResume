    <h1>Instructions for Wordle Game: </h1>
    <p id="inst-text">
        Wordle is a word game in which players must create words from a set of given letters. To play Wordle, you will need to follow these steps:<br>

        You will be presented with a set of letters, which you will use to form words. <br>
        To make a guess, type all 5 letters, and press the enter button or the enter key on the keyboard.<br>
        The colors work as follows: <br>

        <span id="grey">Grey</span> = Letter is not in the word<br>
        <span id="yellow">Yellow</span> = Letter is in the word, just not in this spot<br>
        <span id="green">Green</span> = Letter in in the correct spot in the word.<br>
        You will have 6 guesses to form the correct word and win the game!<br>

        Good luck!<br><br>

<!--
    You'll have 6 chances to guess the 5-letter word of the day, so make every guess count! 
    Try using a word that contains many different letters to narrow down your future guesses. 
    Type your first guess, and then press or click Enter to see if you've matched any letters.

    After you make a guess, the tile colors will change:
    A green tile indicates that you've guessed the correct letter in the correct place in the word.
    A yellow tile means you've guessed a letter that's in the word, but not in the right spot.
    A gray tile means that letter is not in today's word.

    Use the clues you got from your first guess to try again. Remember, don't reuse any of the gray letters, as they are definitely not in today's Wordle.
    If you correctly guessed a letter at the correct position (a green tile), make sure to use that letter at that position in your second guess.
    Letters can appear more than once in the same word.

    
    Continue entering your guesses until all letters are green.
